2D Flash game I wrote in 2013.
Needs https://github.com/samkovaly/MobSurvivalLevelEditor to make levels for it.

Each game consists of the player and mobs that spawn periodically. The player must avoid the mobs by moving and depending on the character chosen, can use melee or projectiles to kill the mobs. Levels are survival based.
Game was never finished.
